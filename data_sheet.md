## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 
This dataset is created to  help city planners and governments anticipate traffic hot spots ahead of time and reduce the stop-and-go stress of millions of commuters .
- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?
Geotab producer of Telematics devices, created this aggregate datasets using data from commercial vehicle telematics devices
 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? 
The dataset includes aggregate stopped vehicle information and intersection wait times at intersections in four major US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago & Philadelphia. 
- Is there any missing data?
EntryStreetName & ExitStreetName are only columns with missing values
- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
No

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
Data was collected using a telematics device fitted in commercial vehicle. 
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
Unknown to the authors of the datasheet	
- Over what time frame was the data collected?
Unknown to the authors of the datasheet

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
Yes it is done by data provider. 
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
Unknown to the authors of the datasheet

## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
It is used for machine learning competion at kaggle website
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
Unknown to the authors of the datasheet
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
Unknown to the authors of the datasheet

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
Yes data is publically available for download on kaggle website
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?  
Unknown to the authors of the datasheet
