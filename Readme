#Objective :
This is a Kaggle competition task I select for a portfolio project. I selected this task because it is related to my industry of public transport also throughout my course I use everyday traffic congestion as a real-world example problem to discuss different machine learning topics.
The Kaggle task is to predict congestion, based on an aggregate measure of stopping distance and waiting times, at intersections in 4 major US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago & Philadelphia. 
The data consists of aggregated trip logging metrics from commercial vehicles, such as semi-trucks. The data have been grouped by :
    intersection
    month
    hour of day
    direction is driven through the intersection
    whether the day was on a weekend or not
For each grouping in the test set, we need to make predictions for three different quantiles, that is, 20th, 50th, and 80th percentiles for:
    The total time stopped at an intersection
    The distance between the intersection and the first place a vehicle stopped while waiting.
Data was downloaded from

First, we will do data analysis then data processing and feature engineering. Then we try different types of regression models. Later will select a model with a minimum root mean square error value and then fine-tune its hyperparameters to further, improve model performance.
